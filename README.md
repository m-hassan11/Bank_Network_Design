# Bank Network Design using Cisco Packet Tracer

This repository contains the design and simulation files for a **secure and scalable bank network** created in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
The network includes a **main head office in Peshawar** and **five regional branches**, with centralized services and secure inter-branch communication.

## 📌 Project Objective

To design and implement a **secure, scalable, and efficient computer network** for a bank, ensuring:
- Centralized management
- Safe inter-branch communication
- High service availability

## 🗺️ Network Overview

- **Main Branch**: Head office in Peshawar
- **Regional Branches**: Panyala, Mansehra, Swabi, Karak, Dera Ismail Khan (DI Khan)
- **Centralized Services**: DNS, Web, Backup, and Database servers at the main branch
- **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)**: For public-facing services like online banking
- **Dynamic Routing**: Using RIP or EIGRP for automatic route learning
- **Static Routing**: Where manual control is needed

## 🧱 Network Components

- **Routers**: Cisco 2901 for each branch
- **Switches**: For internal LAN segmentation
- **End Devices**: PCs, printers, servers
- **Cabling**: Copper straight-through and serial connections


 ## 🔐 Security Features

- **DMZ** for hosting public services (Web, DNS)
- **Dynamic Routing**: RIP or EIGRP for internal network flexibility
- **Static Routing**: For controlled communication paths


## 📘 Conclusion

The project successfully simulates a **realistic, secure, and organized bank network**. It demonstrates:
- Secure inter-branch communication
- Centralized server access
- Scalability for future expansion
